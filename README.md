## About
apk-all-secrets is a tool that can:
* Clone multiple public/private github repositories of an organization and scan them,

Scanning is done by multiple open source tools such as:
* [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) - scans commits for high entropy strings and user provided regular expressions,
* [repo-supervisor](https://github.com/auth0/repo-supervisor) - scans for high entropy strings in .js and .json files

This isn't fully working yet. I'll remove this line once it is.
